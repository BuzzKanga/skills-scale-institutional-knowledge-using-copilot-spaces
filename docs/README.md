# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Docs! This README provides an overview of how project management is run at OctoAcme and direct links to all associated documentation in this docs/ folder. Use this as your entry point to find templates, checklists, and process guidance.

## Project Management Processes — Quick Overview
OctoAcme runs projects with a customer-first, iterative mindset focused on delivering measurable outcomes. Key elements:

- Roles & ownership: Project Manager (day-to-day coordination), Product Lead (prioritization and product direction), Developers (delivery), QA (quality verification), and Stakeholders (business alignment and approvals).
- Lifecycle stages: Initiation -> Planning -> Execution -> Release -> Retrospective. Each stage has defined artifacts and responsibilities.
- Principles: prioritize customer value, keep feedback loops short, make decisions with data, and maintain clear ownership.
- Artifacts & practices: use templates and checklists for initiation and planning, maintain an execution tracker for work in-flight, run regular stakeholder syncs, and capture action items in retrospectives.
- Communication cadence: regular status updates, demos at major milestones, and scheduled retrospectives for continuous improvement.
